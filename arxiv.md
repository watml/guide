1. you can no longer directly wrap pdf in latex. 
2. hyperref may cause problems, especially if you add hyperlinks in bib titles
3. make sure your tex files compile without warnings on overleaf before submitting to arxiv
3. do not trust the error message from arxiv. 
4. arxiv only acceptes .bbl (not .bib files). An easy way is to go to overleaf, in the MENU of your project, choose Tex Live Version 2017, then go to Submit (top) and choose arxiv. Overleaf will generate the bbl file that you can submit to arxiv.

After submission, remember to share the paper password to all coauthors.
